My name is Ben Wang and I am an undergraduate student studying electrical engineering and management at the University of Pennsylvania.


I have a wide range of interests, including power electronics, embedded devices, FPGAs, blockchains, computer vision, networking and AI (Phew that was a mouthfull). I hope to share my journey exploring these topics here.


If you like the work shown here and are looking for someone in these fields, I would love to hear from you!
