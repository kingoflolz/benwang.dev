title: MOC900X

MOC900X is a series of high power density motor drivers which I am designing for the University of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s Formula SAE Electric team, [Penn Electric Racing](http://www.pennelectricracing.com/). This project was started in late 2019, and is currently ongoing.

The goal of this project is to design a high voltage (~600V), high power (~60kW) motor controller for the 2021 season, with strong priorities placed on weight and efficiency. Due to these goals, high performance [GaN transistors](https://gansystems.com/gan-transistors/gs66516b/) were selected and evaluated on a custom insulated metal substrate half bridge test board controlled by an FPGA:

The half bridge design has been validated both electrically and thermally, and performs at over 99% efficiency at 500V, 100A. The current design iteration puts three half bridges together, and is on target to achieve extremely high whole system specific power, on the order of 170kW/kg including cooling, enclosure and connectors
