    <p>RemoteBoot was a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/658903329/remoteboot-wifi-remote-management-module-for-pcs">Kickstarter project</a> which I ran in 2016, when I ran into the frustration of having to leave my computer on all day to be able to remotely access it, having no way of powering it on remotely. Thus, I came up with the idea of RemoteBoot, a module fitting into any desktop computer that allows for remote turn on and monitoring over WiFi.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/remoteboot.png" alt="Picture of the RemoteBoot"></p>

<p>This device consists of a WiFi module (ESP8266), transistors for turning the computer on and off, as well as optoisolators to enable LED monitoring. The firmware was written in C++, with a Javascript web UI, along with a PHP based cloud management interface.</p>

<p>This Kickstarter project was extremely successful, raising AU$17,589 from 431 backers, with 1000 units manufactured in Shenzhen and successfully delivered to all backers. This project was also covered by some engineering youtubers, such as <a href="https://youtu.be/lKhESCFeHy0">Dave Jones from the EEVBlog</a>.</p>

<p>The over 800 devices in use today save significant amounts of energy worldwide, which to date have saved over 600MWh of energy, and reduced CO2 emissions by over 400 tons.</p>
