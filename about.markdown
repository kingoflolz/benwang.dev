Hi! My name is Ben Wang, and I am currently an undergraduate student studying electrical engineering and management
at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in May 2023.

I have a wide range of interests, including large scale AI models, power electronics, embedded devices, FPGAs and
computer vision. I hope to share my journey exploring these topics through interesting projects here!
